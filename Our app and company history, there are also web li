iOS App BitKey: Bitcoin wallet releases v3.0.0 on AppStore. 
As an organization developer: Hangzhou Netcaa Technology Co. , Ltd.

From Sep 1, 2018, BitKey starts to be rejected as uploaded by individual Developer DingFeng, and be asked should be an organization developer.
So we update my original developer account to be an organization developer (Netcaa Technology Co.).

It took us over months to update the developer account, and luck we can develop the iOS App BitKey again.

We want to release an app on Mac which is a multi-signature tool to co-working with BitKey on iPhone.
The Mac app "Netcaa-BitcoinMultisigTool" is being rejected again and again.


I want to say "Netcaa-BitcoinMultisigTool" on Mac is not a complete Bitcoin wallet application. You can't use this app alone to generate any bitcoin-related addresses and transactions. This app is just a multi-signature tool for BitKey app.

We are a Chinese company, and we don't want to avoid any regulation to register false companies elsewhere. ICO is banned in China, but Bitcoin itself is legal and is defined as a special virtual commodity. At the same time, in my city Hangzhou, the government also encourages the blockchain industry and innovation, and key-management technology is a key aspect of blockchain technology.

It would be unsafe if users could only use bitcoin wallets from exchanges and large financial institutions. Many centralized exchanges and institutions that have happened lost many users'assets.

For security, after sell/buy Bitcoins on exchanges,  users need to use separate wallet software to manage their keys. We believe that multi-signature and time-lock is the best solution to solve the key-management problem, so we developed BitKey and "Netcaa-Bitcoin Multisig Tool" to implement this solution.

Using this multi-signature and timelock technology, the user's assets are not worried about loss or theft. Instead of purchasing special hardware wallet, users can manage their Bitcoins properly using their own iPhone and Mac.

I don't think today's exchanges and large financial institutions are aiming to develop purely tools to help individual users manage their keys, nor intend to develop such innovative multi-signature and timelock tools.

So please give us some help. Thank you very much.
